# CleanMyPhone
A small desktop application to help clean my phone by copying all photos from it to the desktop and then delete the photos from the phone (while keeping me in full control as for what to delete and how much)

*This app is still in beta.*

An WebDav Server app (such as https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theolivetree.webdavserver&hl=en) needs to be installed
in the phone in order for the application to work.
